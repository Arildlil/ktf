3. KTF kernel specific features
-------------------------------

Reference to module internal symbols
************************************

When working with unit tests, the need to access non-public interfaces
often arises. In general non-public interfaces is of course not intended to
be used by outside programs, but a test framework is somewhat special here
in that it is often necessary or desirable to unit test internal
data structures or algorithms even if they are not exposed. The program
under test may be a complicated beast by itself and merely exercising the
public interfaces may not be flexible enough to stress the internal code.
Even if it is possible to get the necessary "pressure" from the outside
like that, it might be much more challenging or require a lot more work.

The usual method to gain access to internal interfaces is to be part of the
internals. To some extent this is the way a lot of the kernel testing
utilities operate. The obvious advantages of this is that the test code
'automatically' follows the module and it's changes. The disadvantage is
that test code is tightly integrated with the code itself. One important
goal with KTF is to make it possible to write detailed and sophisticated
test code which does not affect the readability or complexity of the tested
code.

KTF contains a small python program, ``resolve``, which
parses a list of symbol names on the form::

    #module first_module
    #header first_header.h
    private_symbol1
    private_symbol2
    ...
    #header second_header.h
    #module next_module
    ...

The output is a header file and a struct containing function pointers and
some convenience macro definitions to make it possible to 'use' the
internal functions just as one would if within the module. This logic is
based on kallsyms, and would of course only work if that functionality is
enabled in the kernel KTF compiles against.
