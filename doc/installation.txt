4. Building and installing KTF
------------------------------

To build KTF, clone the ktf project, then::

	cd ktf
	autoreconf

Create a build directory somewhere outside the source tree to allow the same KTF source tree to be used
against multiple versions of the kernel. Assuming for simplicity that you
want to build for the running kernel but you can build for any installed ``kernel-*-devel``::

	cd <a dedicated build tree for this kernel>
	mkdir build
	cd build
	~/<path_to_source_root>/ktf/configure KVER=`uname -r`
	make

Now you should have got a ``kernel/ktf.ko`` that works with your test kernel
and modules for the ``examples`` and KTF ``selftest`` directories.
You are ready to create your own test modules based on KTF!
