4. Building and installing KTF
------------------------------

KTF's user land side depends on googletest, which should be available via
your package manager. On Redhat or Fedora it is available as ``gtest`` and ``gtest-devel``.

To build KTF, cd to your source tree (let's assume ~/src for this) then clone the ktf project::

	cd ~/src
	<clone ktf>
	cd ktf
	autoreconf

Create a build directory somewhere outside the source tree to allow the
same KTF source tree to be used against multiple versions of the
kernel. Assuming for simplicity that you want to build for the running
kernel but you can build for any installed ``kernel-*-devel``::

	mkdir -p ~/build/`uname -r`
	cd ~/build/`uname -r`
	mkdir ktf
	cd ktf
	~/src/ktf/configure KVER=`uname -r`
	make

Optionally, ktf also supports ``make install`` and the ``--prefix`` configuration option to
allow you to use a custom install directory. Kernel objects will be
installed under ``kernel/``.

Now you should have got a ``kernel/ktf.ko`` that works with your test kernel
and modules for the ``examples`` and KTF ``selftest`` directories.

Setting up your own test suite based on KTF
*******************************************
You are now ready to create your own test modules based on KTF.
KTF provides a script for setting up KTF based modules in a similar
way as KTF, using the autotools measures implemented in KTF. The script
assumes for simplicity that you want to have your source tree beside the
ktf source::

	~/src/ktf/scripts/ktfnew mysuite
